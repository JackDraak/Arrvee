# Arrvee Music Visualizer

A cross-platform music visualizer application inspired by classic WinAmp visualizers, built in Rust with real-time audio processing and FFT spectral analysis.

## Features

- **Audio File Processing**: Direct analysis of audio files (WAV, MP3, OGG support)
- **Advanced Musical Analysis**: 8+ real-time audio features for rich visualization control
  - **Spectral Features**: Brightness, rolloff, pitch confidence, zero-crossing rate
  - **Rhythm Analysis**: Beat detection, BPM estimation, onset strength
  - **Dynamic Analysis**: Volume tracking, dynamic range, spectral flux
- **Real-time FFT Analysis**: Fast Fourier Transform for frequency spectrum analysis
- **Beat Detection**: Intelligent rhythm detection with adaptive thresholds
- **Frequency Band Analysis**: 5-band separation (sub-bass, bass, mid, treble, presence)
- **GPU-Accelerated Graphics**: Hardware-accelerated rendering with wgpu
- **Audio-Reactive Shaders**: WGSL shaders that respond to music in real-time
- **Developer Tools**: Real-time analysis overlay and volume controls
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Modular Architecture**: Extensible design for adding new visual effects

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Audio file (WAV, MP3, or OGG format)

### Running the Visualizer

**Audio File Visualizer (Recommended):**
```bash
# Clone and navigate to the project
cd Arrvee

# Run with default sample file
cargo run --bin audio-test

# Run with your own audio file
cargo run --bin audio-test path/to/your/music.wav

# Run with developer overlay showing real-time analysis
cargo run --bin audio-test --debug sample.wav
```

The visualizer will:
- Load and play your audio file through speakers
- Analyze the audio data in real-time for frequency content and beats
- Display dynamic, music-reactive graphics that pulse and change color
- Show visual responses synchronized to bass, mid, and treble frequencies

### Controls

**Playback:**
- **Space**: Pause/resume audio playback
- **Escape**: Exit the visualizer

**Developer Mode** (when using `--debug`):**
- **D**: Toggle debug overlay on/off
- **+/=**: Increase volume
- **-**: Decrease volume

**Debug Overlay Features:**
- Real-time frequency band analysis (sub-bass, bass, mid, treble, presence)
- Beat detection with strength and BPM estimation
- Advanced spectral features (brightness, pitch confidence, onset detection)
- Dynamic audio characteristics (volume, dynamic range, spectral flux)

- **FFT**: Fast Fourier Transform implementation for frequency analysis
- **Beat Detector**: Rhythm and beat detection algorithms

### Graphics Engine (`src/graphics/`)
- **Engine**: Core graphics rendering with wgpu (GPU-accelerated)
- **Shader**: WGSL shader management and pipeline creation
- **Vertex**: Vertex buffer management for geometry
- **Texture**: Texture management for visual effects

### User Interface (`src/ui/`)
- **Interface**: egui-based UI for controls and settings
- **Controls**: Playback controls, volume, preset selection

### Effects System (`src/effects/`)
- **Presets**: Predefined visualizer configurations
- **Manager**: Dynamic effect switching and combination

### Shaders (`shaders/`)
- **visualizer.wgsl**: Main visualization shader with:
  - Plasma effects that respond to audio frequency bands
  - Spectrum bar visualization
  - Radial wave patterns
  - Beat-synchronized visual pulses

## Technical Features

### Audio Analysis
- 44.1kHz sampling rate support
- 512-point FFT for real-time frequency analysis
