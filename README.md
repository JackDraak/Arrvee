## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Audio file (WAV, MP3, or OGG format)

### Running the Visualizer

**Audio File Visualizer (Recommended):**
```bash
# Clone and navigate to the project
cd Arrvee

# Run with default sample file
cargo run --bin audio-test

# Run with your own audio file
cargo run --bin audio-test -- path/to/your/music.wav

# Run with developer overlay showing real-time analysis
cargo run --bin audio-test -- --debug sample.wav
```

The visualizer will:
- üéµ Load and play your audio file through speakers
- üß† Analyze the audio data in real-time for 15+ musical characteristics
- üåà Display psychedelic, music-reactive graphics with 5 distinct effect types
- üéõÔ∏è Automatically blend effects based on musical content (bass-heavy ‚Üí plasma, harmonic ‚Üí kaleidoscope, etc.)
- üé® Create trippy visuals that pulse, morph, and transform with the music

### Controls

**Playback:**
- **Space**: Pause/resume audio playback
- **Escape**: Exit the visualizer

**Developer Mode** (when using `--debug`):**
- **D**: Toggle debug overlay on/off
- **+/=**: Increase volume
- **-**: Decrease volume

**Debug Overlay Features:**
- Real-time frequency band analysis (sub-bass, bass, mid, treble, presence)
- Beat detection with strength and BPM estimation
- Advanced spectral features (brightness, pitch confidence, onset detection)
- Dynamic audio characteristics (volume, dynamic range, spectral flux)
- Effect blending weights and current dominant effect display
